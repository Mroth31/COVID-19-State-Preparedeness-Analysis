## An Analysis of U.S Hospital Bed Capacity During the COVID-19 Pandemic
by Michael Rothschilds and Ajay Karatam

## Introduction: 
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the lives of millions over the past few months. 
People have practiced Social Distancing at an unprecedented level with the intention 
of keeping people safe and "flattening the curve". The purpose of "flattening the curve" 
is to prevent hospitals from being overrun with too many COVID-19 patients at once. 
In order to stop this from happening, public health and government officials need to 
project the number of cases, the rate of hospitalization, and the resulting number of 
hospital and ICU beds needed at any given time across all areas of the United States. 
The following data was collected from a team of researchers at the Harvard Global Data Institute. 
They made projections for different infection rates and used surveys conducted by 
The American Hospital Association to predict the true availability of hospital and ICU beds.
According to an article from US news - New York, California, and Washington are currently the most
affected by the virus. With our analysis spanning across the top 300 hospital markets in the US
we can answer the probability of whether hospitals in these affected regions will eventually run
out of beds.

## Part 1: Dataframe Setup and Tidying
We begin our setup by downloading the dataset into our local directory and opening here as a .csv file. Some columns that required separation were split using regex like the ones seen below. This process also included re-arranging as well as omitting some columns for the sake of readability. Furthermore, we added two more columns that served as a mathematical computation of two other columns. The final tidy dataframe is setup as "df" which is what we will be using later on in the analysis. 
```{r Dataframe Setup and Tidying}
csv_file <- "HRR_Scorecard.csv"
hcb <- read_csv(csv_file)

#delete the first entry since it contains garbage values
hcb = hcb[-1,]
df <- hcb %>%
  #choose the relevant columns that we want to work with from hcb 
  select(1:12)
df
#extract the state as a separate column from HRR
df$State <- str_extract(df$HRR, "([A-Z]{2})")

#extract the town as a separate column from HRR
df$Town <- sub(", [A-Z]{2}$", "", df$HRR)

#re-arrange the columns to make the data more presentable
df <- df[c(14,13,2,4,5,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)]

#calculate the percentage of occupied hospital beds
df$calc_hospital = ((df[c(4)] / df[c(3)])*100)
df$`Occupied Hospital Beds percentage` <- round(df$calc_hospital$`Available Hospital Beds`,digits=2) 

#calculate the percent of occupied ICU beds
df$calc_ICU = ((df[c(7)] / df[c(6)])*100)
df$`Occupied ICU Beds percentage` <- round(df$calc_ICU$`Available ICU Beds`, digits=2)

#final columns re-arrangement
df <- df[c(1,2,3,4,5,15,6,7,8,17,9,10,11,12,13)]
head(df)
```

## Part 2: Data Analysis With a Focus on Hospital and ICU Bed Capacity
Given that our data deals with a statistical analysis of the hospital beds and ICU beds availability as well as population age distribtion across the top 300 US hospital markets; we decided to split out analysis into 3 parts to offer a detailed story.


## Step 2.1: Hospital and ICU Dataframe Setup
Most of the attributes for the Hospital and ICU are very similar ex: 'Hospital Beds Availble', 'ICU Beds Available' or 
'Total Hospital Beds', 'Total ICU beds'. It made sense to pull the relevant attributes from the tidy dataframe (df) and used it in our analysis for the Hospital and ICU. 
In the process of setting up this new dataframe, we decided to combine the regions for every state as one entry, we achieved this by adding up all the attributes ex: 'Total Hospital Beds', 'Total ICU Beds'. That way we end up with a more interpretable dataframe of 51 entries and 10 columns. Combining the attributes helps us generalize the analysis to each state rather than every region and this was what we were aiming to do with this project to begin with.
The final two columns that I added were the rate of hospital beds availablity and rate of icu beds availability, both of these attributes help us in understanding how each state's hospital and icu ward compare with one another. 

```{r analysis setup hospital and icu}

beds_df <- df %>%
  select(1:10)%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(`No. of Regions` = n_distinct(Town),
            `Total Hospital Beds` = sum(`Total Hospital Beds`), 
            `Hospital Beds Available` = sum(`Available Hospital Beds`),
            `Potential Hospital Beds Available` = sum(`Potentially Available Hospital Beds*`),
            `Total ICU Beds` = sum(`Total ICU Beds`), 
            `ICU Beds Available` = sum(`Available ICU Beds`),
            `Potential ICU Beds Available` = sum(`Potentially Available ICU Beds*`)
            )%>%
  mutate(`Rate of Hospital beds availability` = (`Hospital Beds Available`/`Total Hospital Beds`)*100)%>%
  mutate(`Rate of ICU beds availability` = (`ICU Beds Available`/`Total ICU Beds`)*100)%>%
  select(1,2,3,4,5,9,6,7,8,10)%>%
  arrange(State)
beds_df
beds_df$`Rate of Hospital beds availability` = round(beds_df$`Rate of Hospital beds availability`, digits=2)
beds_df$`Rate of ICU beds availability` = round(beds_df$`Rate of ICU beds availability`, digits=2)
```


## Step 2.2: Hospital Analysis - Scatter plot of Hospital Beds Occupied vs Available
To interprete this graph, we know that Hospital Beds Available <= Total Beds Available as a universal truth, therefore, a point which is higher on the y-axis is an indication that there are more beds available. Additionally, the closer the x axis is to 0 and a higher y axis point means that the hospital is operating extremely efficiently.
From this plot, there seems be more concentration of points around x <= 20,000 and y <= 5,000; this means that roughly 25% hospital beds are available for most of these states. Ofcourse there are a few states which have more total beds but a higher ratio of occupied beds (>25%).

```{r plot analysis hospital}
  hosp_df <- beds_df %>%
    select(1:6)%>%
    group_by(State, `No. of Regions`)%>%
    arrange(`Rate of Hospital beds availability`)
  hosp_df

  ggplot(hosp_df, mapping=aes(x=`Total Hospital Beds`, y=`Hospital Beds Available`))+
    geom_point(mapping=aes(color = State))+
    ggtitle("Scatter plot of Hospital Beds Occupied vs Available")
```


## Step 2.3: Hospital Analysis - Bargraph of the Top 10 States with the Lowest Rate of Hospital Beds Availability 
The states included in this graph gives the reader an understanding of the population demographics for these regions, it is easy to guess that there could be a significant older adult population. Also the number of regions for each of these states is another indicator of the intensity of beds occupancy. From the graph, New York has the most hospitals as well as the least availability, Rhode Island also has fewer hospitals and a tad lower availability rate. An interesting feature about the states in this list is the fact that most of them belong in the East coast.
```{r step 2.3}
  hosp_df[1:10,] %>%
    ggplot(mapping=aes(x=State, y=`Rate of Hospital beds availability`, fill= `No. of Regions`))+
    geom_col(mapping=aes())+
    ggtitle("Top 10 States with the Lowest Rate of Hospital Beds Availability")
```

## Step 2.4: Hospital Analysis - Linear Regression Model of Hospital: Potential Available Beds vs Available Beds 
This regression plot features a unique attribute which is "Potential Available Beds", this attribute was part of our original dataset and it is a numerical value that represents the scenrario if non-covid patients took up 50% less beds. By plotting this against the current available beds, the regression analysis will help us understand the correlation. Off the bat, it seems like the concentration lies around lower x and y values. The straight linear regression curve is a strong indication that many hospitals can promise 50% more hospital beds.
```{r step 2.4,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  ggplot(hosp_df, mapping=aes(x=`Potential Hospital Beds Available`, y=`Hospital Beds Available`))+
    geom_point(mapping=aes(color = State))+
    geom_smooth(method=lm)+
    ggtitle("Linear Regression Model of Hospital: Potential Available Beds vs Available Beds")
```
## =====================================================================================================================




## Part 3: ICU Analysis


## Step 3.1: Scatter plot of ICU Beds Occupied vs Available 
ICU beds occupancy is an interesting factor to observe simply because of its dependent nature, in other words, ICU beds occupancy is dependant on demographic factors like number of old people or number of hospitals in a given state. From the graph below, similar to the results from the Hospital beds version of this graph, has a lower concentration at lower x and y values. From color inspection is seems like most states are maintaining similar hospital beds and icu beds availability rate. The states within the concetration seem to show that roughy 50% of the icu beds are available. States with more hospital beds show lower availability rate (~30%).

```{r plot analysis icu}
  icu_df <- beds_df %>%
    select(1,2,7,8,9,10)%>%
    group_by(State, `No. of Regions`)%>%
    arrange(`Rate of ICU beds availability`)
  icu_df
  
  ggplot(icu_df, mapping=aes(x=`Total ICU Beds`, y=`ICU Beds Available`))+
    geom_point(mapping=aes(color = State))+
    ggtitle("Scatter plot of ICU Beds Occupied vs Available")
```


## Step 3.2: Bargraph of the Top 10 States with the Lowest Rate of ICU Beds Availability
This plot just like the hospital plot version, compares the top 10 lowest ICU beds availability rates with respect to region. From observations, Nevada has the lowest availability rate while also having the least number of regions, Florida on the other hand has roughly 8% higher availability rate and significantly more regions.
It is interesting to find that Georgia, Rhode Island, Nevada, Hawaii, North Carolina; all of which were featured in both hospital and ice bargraphs; this is an indication of hospital inefficiency in these regions as well higher demand.

```{r step 3.2}
  icu_df[1:10,] %>%
    ggplot(mapping=aes(x=State, y=`Rate of ICU beds availability`, fill= `No. of Regions`))+
    geom_col(mapping=aes())+
    ggtitle("Top 10 States with the Lowest Rate of ICU Beds Availability")
```  


## Step 3.3: Linear Regression Model of ICU: Potential Available Beds vs Available Beds
As discussed earlier in the hospital plot, the potential available beds attribute introduces an efficient method to increase hospital beds occupancy for covid patients. Interestingly enough, the linear regression is similar to the one we observed earlier, this means that most hospitals can promise 50% more ICU beds for most states in the concentraion. However, unlike hospital beds, ICU beds can be optimized to offer 50% more even for hospitals with 4000 or more beds. This is a nod to the 1:2 ratio nature of the relation.

```{r step 3.3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  ggplot(icu_df, mapping=aes(x=`Potential ICU Beds Available`, y=`ICU Beds Available`))+
    geom_point(mapping=aes(color = State))+
    geom_smooth(method=lm)+
    ggtitle("Linear Regression Model of ICU: Potential Available Beds vs Available Beds")
  
```
## =============================================================================================================



## Part 4: Data Analysis with a Focus on State Population and Projected Infection Rates
The purpose of this section is to take the entire dataset and use it to create a smaller 
dataset that focuses on the population.

## Step 4.1: 
Obtain this smaller dataset that includes Town, State, Adult 
Population, Population 65+, Projected Infected Individual, 
Projected Hospitalized Individuals, and Projected Individuals Needing ICU Care. 

``` {r step4.1}
pop_df <- df %>% select(Town, State, `Adult Population`, `Population 65+`, 
`Projected Infected Individuals`, `Projected Hospitalized Individuals`, 
`Projected Individuals Needing ICU Care`)
```

## Step 4.2:
Turn the region data into statewide data by grouping by state and using summarize to 
add the totals for each state. The statewide data allows the opportunity to compare the 
risks that states are facing based on total population. The dataset contains all of the 
large regional hospitals, so we felt that the transition to statewide data would be seamless. 

``` {r step4.2}
states_pop_df <- pop_df %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Adult_Population = sum(`Adult Population`), 
  `Population 65+` = sum(`Population 65+`), 
  Projected_Infected_Individuals = sum(`Projected Infected Individuals`), 
  Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals = sum(`Projected Hospitalized Individuals`), 
  Projected_ICU_Care = sum(`Projected Individuals Needing ICU Care`))
```

## Step 4.3:
Once statewide data exists, we next wanted to show how much the risk would increase if 60 percent 
of the adult population contracted the virus in each state. In order to provide a snapshot, we 
tripled the number of Projected Infected Individuals, Projected Hospitalized Individuals, and 
Projected Individuals Needing ICU Care. This represents a 200 percent increase in each category 
over the original twenty percent. This is a plausible estimate according to various projection models.

``` {r step4.3}

states_pop_df <- states_pop_df %>%
  mutate(DoomsDay_Projected_Infected_Individuals = Projected_Infected_Individuals * 3, 
  Doomsday_Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals = Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals *3, 
  Doomsday_Projected_ICU_Care = Projected_ICU_Care * 3)

```

## Step 4.4: 
After doing this, we created a scatterplot showing the difference in the number of hospitalizations
with the exact same adult population to emphasize how much worse this plausible scenario could make 
the situation. This scatterplot highlighted the risks that higher population states face if they aren’t 
properly equipped. 

``` {r step4.4}
states_pop_df %>%
  mutate(difference_in_hospitilzations = 
  Doomsday_Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals - Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = difference_in_hospitilzations, y= Adult_Population, color= State))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Difference in Projected Hospitilizations in Each State", 
  x="Difference", y="Number of Adults")
  
  
``` 

## Step 4.5: 
When focusing solely on population, one of the most important things to consider is the proportion 
of people who are older than 65.  According to the CDC, this demographic is at highest risk for this 
virus as they are much more likely to be hospitalized when they contract the virus. In order to depict 
this across the fifty states, we created a scatterplot with the adult population mapped to the y-axis 
and the percentage of adults older than 65 on the x axis for each state.  

``` {r step4.5}
states_pop_df %>%
  mutate(Percentage_Adults_Older_65 = (`Population 65+` / Adult_Population) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=Percentage_Adults_Older_65, y= Adult_Population, color = State))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Percentage of Adults Older than 65 In Each State", x="Percentage", 
  y="Number of Adults")
  
```
## Step 4.6:
Furthermore, we used the proportion of adult population and the projected number of hospitalizations 
to calculate a risk level by state just according to the population. The purpose of this is to depict how 
a more frequent older population puts a state at risk. When you combine that with questionable hospital 
supplies, a state can be in major trouble. A study done by researchgate details the struggles hospitals go through to compensate for a lack of supplies. It decreases the probability that a patient will receive the best possible care when in critical condition.  

``` {r step4.6}
states_pop_df <- states_pop_df %>% 
  mutate(Risk_Level = (Projected_Hospitalized_Individuals + `Population 65+`) / Adult_Population) %>%
  arrange(desc(Risk_Level))

select(states_pop_df, State, Risk_Level)
```
## ==================================================================================================================


## Part 5: Merging the Two Data Frames To Calculate a Preparedness Score

## Step 5.1: 
We merged the beds data frame from parts 2 and 3 with the population data frame from part 4.

```{r merge}
  merge_df <- merge(beds_df, states_pop_df, by="State")
```


## Step 5.2: 

In order to quantify which states were the most prepared and which states were the least prepared, 
we used the merged dataset to calculate a preparedness score. In order to calculate the score, we 
derived a formula that uses the percentage of population 65 and older, the rate of hospital bed 
availability, and the rate of ICU bed availability. We felt that these factors differentiated the states 
the most and concluded that the rate of available hospital and ICU beds was more than twice as important 
as the percentage of elderly population in a state. This formula produced a score on a scale of 0 to 100
and is represented by the continuous attribute "preparedness_score". The states who were the most prepared 
had scores in the 65-90 range, while the states who were the least prepared had scores in the 43-55 range. 

``` {r step5.2}

merge_df <- merge_df %>% 
  mutate(Preparedness_Score = ((`Population 65+`/Adult_Population)*.3 +
                          ((`Rate of Hospital beds availability`/100) + 
                          (`Rate of ICU beds availability`/100)) *.70)*100)
```

## Step 5.3: 
Once we calculated our preparedness_score, we created a separate data frame to prepare for Logistic Regression.
This data frame includes all of the pertinent variables in our regression model, including the building blocks 
for the calculation of each preparedness_score.

``` {r step5.3}

fit_df <- select(merge_df, State, `Rate of Hospital beds availability`, 
`Rate of ICU beds availability`, Adult_Population, `Population 65+`, Preparedness_Score)

fit_df <- fit_df %>%
  mutate(Percentage_65_older = (`Population 65+` / Adult_Population) * 30, 
  Hospital_Bed_Availability = ((`Rate of Hospital beds availability`/100) + 
  (`Rate of ICU beds availability`/100))*70)

```
## Step 5.4:
We perform logistic regression using the fit_df created in step 5.3. The purpose of doing this is to
quantify the relationship between preparedness_scores and the two independent variables. The 
preparedness score is the dependent variable whilethe Percentage_65_older and the Hospital_Bed_Availability 
are the independent variables. Using the broom library, the tidy function with our model produces a p value 
of 0.25, which tells us that our relationship is relatively strong, but not strong enough to be statistically 
significant.

``` {r step5.4}
lm_df <- glm(Preparedness_Score ~ Percentage_65_older + Hospital_Bed_Availability, data=fit_df)
broom::tidy(lm_df)
lm_df%>%
  tidy()%>%
  knitr::kable(digits=4)

```

## Step 5.5:
We used the results of the logistic regression to graph the residuals versus the fitted values. Our residuals 
appear to skew a little below zero, but they are within a reasonable range of zero.

``` {r step5.5}

ggplot(lm_df, mapping=aes(x=lm_df$fitted.values, y=lm_df$residuals))+
    geom_point(mapping=aes(color = lm_df$data$State))+
    geom_smooth(method=lm)+
    labs(title="Logistic Regression model of Residuals over Fitted Values",
        y = "Residuals",
         x = "Fitted Values",
        color = "State")
fit_df$fitted_values <- lm_df$fitted.values
```
======================================================================================================================


## Part 6: Visually Depicting the Tiers of Preparedness_Score
In order to assess each state's preparedness score with respect to one another, we decided to utilize the leaflet library. We started off by downloading a csv file from kaggle with the co-ordinates for each state and then merged it with our data to create a new data frame (map_df). Using the preparedness score for each state, we color coded them in order to show visually which states could be at risk. As the preparedness score ranges roughly from 40-95, with 40 being considered least prepared, the color sequence follows that range as well with Red indicating a state is poorly equipped where as blue is an indication of a strongly equipped state (the sequence follows Red->Orange->Yellow->Green->Blue). An interesting feature of the map is the popup option, clicking a circle for any state will reveal details about it's preparedness score. By examining a map containing impacted states directly from CDC.gov, our map analysis is in sync in terms of impacted states. Our map shows that most east-coast states were at higher risk and this reflects very accurately with the map from the CDC website, additionally, states in the mid-west of America shown to have a higher preparedness score which once again happens to be a mirror reflection of the map from the CDC.


```{r map}
#https://www.kaggle.com/washimahmed/usa-latlong-for-state-abbreviations
csv_file <- "statelatlong.csv"
sll <- read_csv(csv_file)

map_df <- merge(sll, fit_df, by = "State")

map_df$Preparedness_Score = round(map_df$Preparedness_Score, digits = 2)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = as.character(map_df$Preparedness_Score)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = paste(", Preparedness Score = ", map_df$Preparedness_Score)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = paste(map_df$City , map_df$Preparedness_Score)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = paste(map_df$Preparedness_Score, ", Adult Population = ")
map_df$Adult_Population = as.character(map_df$Adult_Population)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = paste(map_df$Preparedness_Score, map_df$Adult_Population)
map_df$Preparedness_Score = paste("State = ",map_df$Preparedness_Score)

pal <- colorFactor(c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"), domain = c(map_df$fitted_values))

prep_map <- leaflet(map_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  #Longitude and Latitude of Kansas was used as the default map co-ordinates.
  setView(lat=38.49, lng=-98.32, zoom=4) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~map_df$fitted_values/2.2, popup = map_df$Preparedness_Score,
                   color = ~pal(map_df$fitted_values), fillOpacity = 0.8)
prep_map

```

## Part7: Conclusion
Covid-19 rocked the world over the past few months and many people are suffering from the virus as we speak, this is the worst nightmare for many hospitals around the US. By inspecting the beds occupancy rate for the top 300 US hospital markets, we were able to determine that states with low adult population, specifically population with ages over 65; those regions had a low occupancy rate and therefore are better prepared to handle a sudden surge in cases. The safest states that we determined happened to be located around mid-west US: Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Idaho.
With that being said, the dichotomy between states which are well-prepared and not is drastic. States along the east-coast -> south: Rhode Island, New York, Delaware, Washington D.C, Georgia, Florida; all these states are least prepared against the virus and this is due to a combination of high rates of hospital occupancy and high population of old-age people. Our findings are accurate based on the current scenario when comparing it with the map from CDC.gov which pointed out the states that are most affected by the virus, however, these scenarios are subject to change if proper pre-cautions are not taken in place to "lower the curve".
