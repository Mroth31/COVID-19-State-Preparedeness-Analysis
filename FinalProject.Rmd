## Dataframe Setup and Tidying

## Tasks: 

## 1. Remove the First Row that states that the dataset is based on a 50 percent reduction in occupancy.
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
csv_file <- "HRR_Scorecard.csv"
hcb <- read_csv(csv_file)

#delete the first entry since it contains garbage values
hcb = hcb[-1,]
df <- hcb %>%
  #choose the relevant columns that we want to work with from hcb 
    select(1:12) %>%
    
df
  
  
  
```
