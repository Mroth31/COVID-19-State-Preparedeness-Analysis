Project Plan

What's done so far - 
Data Planning, Scraping, Management

What are we trying to show/convey with our analysis?
- A detailed analysis by state 

Call Discussion
 - We decided to create two new dataframes
    A. This data frame will start off by combining all the data from the columns for every region per state.
        Timeline
        1)Total up the hospital/ICU beds columns including predicted
        2)Create a new column that counts how many regions are in each state (should ideally end up with a 50 
            entry dataframe)
        3)Perform data analysis on this by showling a linear regression model and a ggplot for top 10 states.
        4)Mimic the same setup and analysis for both Hospital and ICU.
    
    B. This data frame will focus on the general population
        Timeline
        1)We want to create a new data frame with population focusing on infected individuals including other 
            factors like ages >65. Calculate a doomsday scenario where 50% of adults are infected and make 
            projections with reference to the original dataframe to come to this calculation.
        2)Now use this data to create a linear regression model and use machine learning to show future analysis.
        3)Based on this data we can use leaflet using a map of the US and color pin the states based on current
            scenario and once again create another leaflet plot to show the doomsday scenario.
            Ideally we would want to have the radius increase for states showing higher risks.

Things we still need to figure out
- The bridge between part A analysis and part B analysis.
- The machine learning setup for part B.
